# Neural network for predicting star temperature

### Project description

The observatory wants to introduce machine learning technologies to predict the temperature of stars.

The observatory's database contains the characteristics of 240 stars that have already been studied.

### The purpose of the project
To develop a neural network that will predict the absolute temperature on the surface of a star. The RMSE metric should be less than 4,500.

### Project plan:
1. EDA. Prepare the data. Handle anomalies, missing values, duplicates.
2. Create a simple neural network and train it.
3. Make improvements to the neural network.
3. Analyze models and recommend the best for customer's criteria.

### Libraries used
`pandas`, `PyTorch`, `scikit-learn`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`
